# Weather Forecasting on Timeseries Data using RNNs

Dataset: https://s3.amazonaws.com/keras-datasets/jena_climate_2009_2016.csv.zip

* Weather timeseries dataset recorded at the Weather Station at the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry in Jena, Germany.
* In this dataset, 14 different quantities (such air temperature, atmospheric pressure, humidity, wind direction, and so on) were recorded every 10 minutes. 
* Built a model that takes as input some data from the recent past (a few daysâ€™ worth of data points) and predicts the air temperature 24 hours in the future.
